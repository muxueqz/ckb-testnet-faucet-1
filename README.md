# About CKB

CKB is the layer 1 of Nervos Network, a public/permissionless blockchain. CKB uses [Proof of Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) and [improved Nakamoto concensus](https://medium.com/nervosnetwork/breaking-the-throughput-limit-of-nakamoto-consensus-ccdf65fe0832) to achieve maximized performance on average hardware and internet condition, without sacrificing decentralization and security which are the core value of blockchain.
